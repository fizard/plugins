# Fizard Plugins

Plugins and agent skills by [Fizard](https://fizard.com) — for Claude Code,
Codex, and any agent that speaks the open Agent Skills format. Install once,
then get every update automatically (or with one command).

## Install

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add fizard/plugins
/plugin install qonto-matchmaker@fizard
```

To receive updates automatically: `/plugin` → **Marketplaces** tab →
select `fizard` → **Enable auto-update**. Or update manually any time with
`/plugin marketplace update fizard`.

### Codex

```
codex plugin marketplace add fizard/plugins
```

Then open `/plugins` in Codex, find **Fizard**, and install `qonto-matchmaker`.

### Cursor and other agents (skill only)

```
npx skills add fizard/plugins
```

The [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) detects your
installed agents and puts the skill where each expects it. Update any time
with `npx skills update`.

## Plugins

### Fizard Qonto Matchmaker (`qonto-matchmaker`)

The matchmaker between your inbox and your bank account: finds Qonto
transactions with missing receipts, matches invoice PDFs from your email
inbox against them (exact amount, vendor, date), and — on your say-so —
attaches them to the transactions via the Qonto MCP.

**Qonto connection is bundled:** the plugin ships the Qonto MCP server
config (`https://mcp.qonto.com/mcp`); on first use you just log in to Qonto
once (Claude Code: `/mcp` → qonto → authenticate). Already using the Qonto
MCP? Nothing changes — the bundled config is deduplicated against your
existing connection, which keeps working as-is.

**Email access you connect yourself**, depending on what you use:

- **Gmail / Google Workspace:** Google's official remote MCP server
  ([setup guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides/configure-mcp-server)
  — requires a Google Cloud project and OAuth client, one-time admin setup).
- **Outlook / Microsoft 365:** e.g. the community
  [ms-365-mcp-server](https://github.com/softeria/ms-365-mcp-server)
  (`claude mcp add ms365 -- npx -y @softeria/ms-365-mcp-server`).

Try it: *"Wo fehlen Belege?"* or *"Reconcile my receipts."*

## Release workflow (Fizard-internal)

1. Update skill content under `plugins/<plugin>/skills/`.
2. Bump the version (scheme `YEAR.MONTH.PATCH`) in **all three** places:
   - `plugins/<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   - `plugins/<plugin>/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
   - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
3. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
4. Commit and push. Claude Code clients with auto-update get the new version
   on their next start; Codex and skills-CLI clients on their next update.

## Structure

```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json          Claude Code catalog
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json         Codex catalog
plugins/qonto-matchmaker/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json           Claude Code manifest + version
├── .codex-plugin/plugin.json            Codex manifest + version
├── .mcp.json                            bundled Qonto MCP server config
└── skills/reconcile-invoices/SKILL.md   the skill — one file, all agents
CHANGELOG.md                             what changed per release
```

Both plugin systems expect `skills/` at the plugin root, so a single plugin
directory carries both manifests and one shared SKILL.md. New plugins get
their own `plugins/<name>/` directory plus an entry in **both** catalogs.
