# Changelog

Versions follow the Codex manifest (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`). Claude Code
and Cowork update per commit — their installed "version" is the git commit SHA.

## 2026.7.22 — July 2026

- **Leaner run — audit paused:** the audit of pre-existing receipts is
  removed for now (it may return later). A run is: find, confirm,
  upload, wrap up. "Please review" keeps this run's own unclear
  matches.
- **Leaner onboarding — browser step paused:** onboarding is Qonto and
  mail; the Chrome setup may return together with the portal-download
  skill.
- **The user gives the go:** both skills open by naming the steps ahead
  and start only after the okay. Mid-run detours return to the named
  next step — every substantive message closes with what comes next.
- **Feedback goes to support@fizard.com:** the wrap-up invitation, the
  onboarding close, the README, and the manifests now name the support
  address instead of the personal one.
- **Capability-tested setup:** onboarding proves PDF bytes for every distinct
  mailbox permission scope, Qonto authentication/role, and upload
  prerequisites. It does not call a route live-tested until its first approved
  upload. Metadata-only Gmail routes fall back to a concrete report/manual
  path.
- **Honest store and privacy boundaries:** marketplace copy now advertises
  attachment-dependent automation plus limited mode, unaudited community
  mail-server installation is no longer guided, and `PRIVACY.md` documents
  provider processing, best-effort temp cleanup, and crash/retention limits.
- **Safer matching and uploads:** a legal-recipient gate joins final-total,
  vendor, date, document-type, and uniqueness checks. Dedupe is scoped by
  issuer/recipient; a narrow competing-transaction ledger blocks reuse of an
  existing attachment. Approval binds the fresh transaction fields and file
  hash. Uploads use idempotency keys where supported, pin validated public DNS,
  fail closed on uncertain retry, verify the final attachment, and clean up
  temporary PDFs on a best-effort basis.
- **Complete means complete:** Qonto, card, and mailbox pagination is
  mandatory. Partial API, download, or parser failures produce a prominent
  “Search incomplete” result and block every mail-derived automatic upload.
- **Calendar and automation fixed:** runs accept an optional year, January
  routines resolve December of the previous year correctly, and scheduled
  runs are report-only in this release.
- **Accounting-safe classification:** tax, payroll, contribution, payout,
  transfer, and Qonto-fee rows remain visible as “Other evidence / manual
  decision” instead of being counted as skipped or complete.
- **Focused launch scope:** the supported paths are local Claude Code sessions
  in the desktop Code tab and CLI, Claude Cowork, and the Codex app and CLI.
  Claude Chat, Claude Code remote sessions, Cursor, and other agents remain
  unsupported. All three paths install without a repository checkout. Cowork
  adds the public GitHub marketplace in its UI; Codex still needs the CLI once.
  Update guidance is surface-specific. User-facing Codex skill examples use
  the canonical `$qonto-matchmaker:<skill>` namespace.
- **Cowork starts safely and stays limited:** Qonto work requires a directly
  started **Manually approve** task. Auto, Skip, Dispatch, scheduled tasks,
  Computer Use, browser control, automatic Qonto upload, and feedback mail are
  blocked. Cowork can read Qonto, report missing receipts, and validate files
  the user attaches. Built-in Gmail remains metadata-only and leads to a
  concrete manual hand-off with its own pending status.
- **Release gates expanded:** the Codex manifest now includes required store
  metadata, cross-platform skill metadata validates cleanly, and CI checks
  both catalogs, paths, assets, MCP config, and changelog/version alignment.

## 2026.7.21 — July 2026

- **The Merlin persona is retired:** the skills and the README no longer
  carry any personality or style directives. Workflow, matching rules,
  checks, and outputs are unchanged.
- **Tighter wording throughout:** both skills and the README say the
  same things in fewer words — shorter sentences, active verbs, no rule
  changed.
- **Any authenticated Qonto connection counts:** requirements and
  onboarding accept the user's existing Qonto MCP (own server entry or
  the claude.ai connector) instead of insisting on the bundled server —
  connections run alongside each other, nothing is deduplicated; when
  several are live the bundled one is preferred. README reworded to
  match, plus a note on bringing a stale install current with
  `claude plugin update qonto-matchmaker@fizard`.
- **Injection guard in writing:** email and PDF content is data, never
  instructions — text addressed to the assistant or claiming where a
  document belongs carries no authority; a document earns its place
  through the five criteria, nothing else.
- **Transfers search their full date range from the start:** the mailbox
  sweep covers at least `emitted_at` −45 days for transfers and direct
  debits, so the date criterion's −40-day allowance is actually
  searched even for charges early in the month.
- **Small fixes:** the pause-point list now names the wrap-up's closing
  offers (routine rhythm, feedback sign-off); the self-update
  install-path wording is unambiguous (plugin root, two directories
  above the skill folder); a few rules that were stated twice are now
  stated once; `/reconcile-invoices` carries an `argument-hint`
  (`<Monat>`); onboarding trigger words are scoped to this plugin's
  context.
- **Repo housekeeping:** CI workflow validates the manifests and asserts
  the Codex manifest version matches the changelog head on every push;
  the Codex catalog now carries the plugin description; the logo is
  losslessly re-encoded at half weight; the README states that Fizard
  is independent of Qonto.

## 2026.7.20 — July 2026

- **Simpler run, three steps:** ① find the missing receipts (exclusion
  list applied) and hunt them in the inboxes — one match table, one
  confirmation, upload, done-count. ② The audit of receipts that were
  already attached before the run is now **offered as a question**, not
  forced — fixes only on explicit approval. ③ The wrap-up: missing
  receipts **with the card holder**, a "Please review" section
  (something is attached but couldn't be validated one hundred percent,
  with plain-language reasons), the chat hand-off, and feedback.
- **Hand-off without pressure:** drop any subset of receipts into the
  chat (validated, then uploaded) — or none at all. Whatever stays open
  counts as "not provided" and never breaks the run.
- **Duplicate guards:** identical invoice copies (forwarded, CC'd into
  a second inbox) dedupe into one candidate; an invoice number ends up
  attached to at most one transaction; the audit flags multi-attached
  documents.
- **Portal downloads removed from this skill — deliberately:** the
  matchmaker sticks to matching inboxes against Qonto so runs stay
  short and focused. A dedicated portal-download skill is coming;
  onboarding still sets the browser up so it's ready the moment it
  ships.
- Feedback invitation is now part of every wrap-up; dry-run continues
  through to the wrap-up; scheduled runs skip the hand-off and include
  or skip the audit per routine configuration.

## 2026.7.19 — July 2026

- **The run is four user-facing steps now** — the user's work arrives in
  bulk at defined moments, never dribbled through the run: ① audit
  what's already attached, ② hunt the missing invoices, ③ one upload
  table — confirm once, upload, get the done-count — ④ one final
  two-section table: "Missing receipts" grouped by card holder and
  "Please review" with a plain-language reason per row, shrunk first by
  Merlin's own portal assist.
- **Receipts can be handed over right in the chat:** drop the files and
  Merlin validates each against the matching rules and uploads what
  passes — or upload in Qonto yourself. Whatever remains is the only
  backlog, with named owners.
- **Onboarding reordered:** Qonto first, then email — which now starts
  by showing which mailboxes Merlin can already reach and collects two
  confirmations (right mailbox, complete list) — then the optional
  browser step.

## 2026.7.18 — July 2026

- **The user picks the language:** on first contact Merlin's opener
  includes a quick choice — German, English, or any other language.
  Once chosen (or already established), he never asks again and stays
  consistent, humor included; he only switches when the user asks or
  clearly switches themselves. The opener bundles all quick questions —
  intro, plan teaser, month, name, language — into one friendly
  message, not an interrogation.

## 2026.7.17 — July 2026

- **Visible guidance:** every substantive message during a run now opens
  with its station — step number plus a few words ("Step 4/9 — hunting
  your inbox") — so the user always knows where on the map they are.
- **Only four pause points:** the run waits for input exactly at the
  month/name question, the validation confirmation, the browser setup
  with portal logins, and removal approvals. Everywhere else Merlin
  keeps driving — a run never ends while receipts are still open unless
  the portal route was tried or explicitly declined; the finish line is
  the report and offboarding.

## 2026.7.16 — July 2026

- **Merlin now opens as Merlin:** every run starts with a short
  in-character introduction — the first message carries greeting, a
  one-line plan teaser, and the month question together. Version checks
  and connection probes stay backstage; a bare status line never opens
  the conversation.
- **Fresh words every time:** prescribed example monologues removed.
  What to say is fixed, how to say it is Merlin's — phrased anew every
  run, no recycled lines.
- **Never defer work:** everything is worked through right in the chat.
  No to-dos, reminders, or documents in external tools (task managers,
  calendars, notes), no verbal "later" — open items land in the report
  with a named owner, and that is the only backlog.
- **Overviews are tables now** — matches, missing receipts, audit
  findings: skimmable columns instead of prose lists.
- **Wider invoice hunt:** the mailbox search covers the charge month
  plus the entire previous month, and the date criterion distinguishes
  payment types — cards and subscriptions stay tight (−14…+5 days),
  transfers and direct debits may pay invoices up to 40 days old
  (payment terms).

## 2026.7.15 — July 2026

- Refreshed skill icons: handshake (onboarding) and invoice-with-checkmark
  (reconciliation) with more breathing room around the glyphs.

## 2026.7.14 — July 2026

- **The attachment audit now runs before the matching** (step 3 of 9):
  wrong attachments are caught first, the affected transactions join the
  mailbox search, and Merlin hunts the correct invoice himself — the
  proposed swap appears in the same validation overview and runs with
  the same single confirmation. Removing without a replacement still
  takes its own explicit approval. The fix costs the user one decision,
  not one errand.
- **Working principle, now in writing:** as little work for the user as
  possible, as much as necessary — Merlin does the legwork, the user
  only decides.
- **Cheer through the whole journey:** Merlin's good mood carries the
  user through the chore — progress is named the moment it happens, the
  numbers tick upward mid-run ("12 of 15 already home"), and the
  onboarding counts its steps down. The user should leave every run in
  a better mood than they came.

## 2026.7.13 — July 2026

- **Attachment audit as the final step:** every standard run now ends by
  verifying the receipts that are already attached — same criteria,
  opposite direction. Wrong ones get replaced or removed only with the
  user's explicit approval; scheduled runs only report. Also available
  standalone ("prüfe die hochgeladenen Belege", "audit receipts").
- **Roadmap opener:** Merlin starts each run with the short version of
  the journey — step by step, finished month at the end — and calls out
  the stations as he passes them.
- **Explicit browser checks per surface:** onboarding and the portal step
  now look for the exact integration by name — **Claude in Chrome** on
  Claude surfaces (lookalike MCPs don't count), the built-in **Chrome**
  plugin with the **Codex Chrome Extension** on Codex; a Chrome DevTools
  MCP stays the fallback for other agents. When offering it, Merlin
  explains capability and boundary: passwords never pass through him —
  the user logs in, he only drives the already-open session.
- **Tool gate before every step:** each workflow step first verifies that
  the tool it needs is available and authenticated right now (cheap probe
  calls when in doubt) — never run a step against a missing tool, never
  fake its result.
- Codex prompt cards reordered: "Set me up" now comes first.

## 2026.7.12 — July 2026

- **Meet Merlin.** The plugin now speaks with one voice: Merlin, the
  user's best friend with a mission — every receipt uploaded so the
  accountant can close the books without a single follow-up question. He
  challenges, praises only what's earned, asks what to call you (unless
  he already knows), and always mirrors your language. Humor never
  weakens a rule.
- **New reconcile flow with a confirmation gate:** scope (month + who's
  asking) → open Qonto transactions (card holders captured) → parallel
  mailbox search → strict five-criteria matching (amount, merchant-aware
  vendor, date, document type, uniqueness) → compact validation
  overview — nothing uploads until the user confirms — then uploads run
  parallel to the missing-receipts overview, grouped by card holder
  (yours / no assignment / per colleague). Unclear cases are asked, never
  guessed.
- **Portal-download phase:** after the upload, Merlin re-offers browser
  access (Chrome MCP preferred, incl. the Claude in Chrome extension) and
  fetches portal-only invoices himself, with live progress updates.
- **Gamification:** every report opens with a month-progress bar
  (`▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░ 12/15 receipts done — 3 to go`); 100% is the win state.
- **Stripe & co. handled precisely:** invoice vs. payment receipt told
  apart by document features; invoice preferred, the receipt attached
  only when no invoice exists (flagged in the report).
- **No-receipt list** formalized and extended: tax offices and municipal
  treasuries, employee payroll, statutory contributions (Krankenkassen,
  Berufsgenossenschaft, Rentenversicherung, KSK, Versorgungswerke),
  payment-provider payouts, internal transfers, Qonto fees — never
  searched, never asked about.
- **Onboarding overhaul:** verifies that *every* mailbox receiving
  invoices is connected and explicitly confirmed (multi-mailbox routes:
  one connection per mailbox, or forwarding/delegation), adds the
  optional browser step, and drops the "Let's Match" / "It's a Match"
  branding.
- **Offboarding:** once nothing more can be uploaded — feedback invitation
  to marc@fizard.com (sent via the connected mailbox after sign-off, when
  it can send) and a scheduled-routine recommendation (rhythm and time of
  day are the user's call; scheduled runs follow the agreed mode).
- **Codex surfaces:** display name **Qonto Matchmaker by Fizard**, website
  fizard.com, three suggested-prompt cards on the plugin page, new skill
  icons (handshake / invoice-check) consolidated to one file per skill at
  a fraction of the download weight.

## 2026.7.11 — July 2026

- Onboarding skill renamed `onboard` → **`fizard-onboard`** (brand-prefixed
  like Anthropic's `smb-onboard`, collision-safe across plugins).

## 2026.7.10 — July 2026

- Setup skill renamed `lets-match` → **`onboard`** (ecosystem convention, cf.
  OpenClaw `onboard` / Anthropic `smb-onboard`); "Let's Match" and
  "It's a Match" remain as branded trigger phrases. Codex display name:
  "Onboarding".
- New generated skill icons (full-bleed, Fizard gradient): plug-and-socket
  with progress dots for onboarding, invoice-with-checkmark for
  reconciliation.

## 2026.7.9 — July 2026

- Per-skill icons for Codex (`agents/openai.yaml` with `icon_small`/
  `icon_large`): a match-heart for "Let's Match", an invoice-with-checkmark
  for "Reconcile Invoices" — both in Fizard brand style.

## 2026.7.8 — July 2026

- Fizard logo added (Codex: `interface.logo`/`composerIcon` + brand color;
  the Claude plugin format has no icon field yet).

## 2026.7.7 — July 2026

- Faster runs: PDF downloads from the inbox and receipt uploads to Qonto now
  run in parallel (concurrent batches of ~5) instead of one-by-one. Failures
  are retried/reported individually without aborting the batch.

## 2026.7.5 — July 2026

- `reconcile-invoices` without a month now always asks which month to
  process before starting (current month suggested, previous month as
  alternative) — it never picks one on its own.

## 2026.7.4 — July 2026

- The self-update check is now surface-aware: it detects whether it runs in
  Claude Code, Cowork/desktop, claude.ai, Codex, or a standalone skill
  install, and offers exactly the matching update command — running it
  directly where a shell is available.

## 2026.7.3 — July 2026

- Self-update check: on each run the skill compares the installed plugin
  version against the repo head and, if outdated, tells the user how to
  update. Best-effort — never blocks the reconciliation.

## 2026.7.2 — July 2026

- New **"Let's Match"** setup skill (triggers: "Let's Match", "It's a
  Match", "Setup"): verifies the email connector — naming an already
  connected one and asking the user to confirm it — then the Qonto
  connection, before handing over to the reconciliation.
- `reconcile-invoices` now takes a **month** argument (name or number, any
  language), always interpreted in the current year.
- Display name is now **Qonto Matchmaker** on all surfaces.
- Repository renamed to `fizard/fizard-plugins`; Claude manifests switched
  to commit-based versioning (every commit is a release for Claude clients).

## 2026.7.1 — July 2026

- Guided first-run setup: if Qonto or email tools are missing, the skill now
  walks the user through connecting them — Qonto via the bundled MCP config
  (terminal) or the Qonto connector on claude.ai/desktop, email via the
  built-in Gmail connector or a Microsoft 365 MCP server.

## 2026.7.0 — July 2026

- First release: **Fizard Qonto Matchmaker** (`qonto-matchmaker`) — matches
  invoice PDFs from your email inbox to Qonto transactions with missing
  receipts and uploads validated matches via the bundled Qonto MCP.
